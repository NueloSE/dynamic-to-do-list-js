# Dynamic To-Do List Application
## Project Description
This project is a dynamic To-Do List web application developed as part of the ALX Front-End Web Development program, focusing on advanced JavaScript concepts. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application allows users to add, display, and remove tasks, with data persistence across browser sessions using localStorage. The project demonstrates proficiency in DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage management, creating a seamless and interactive user experience.

## About the To-Do List Application
The To-Do List application is a clean, user-friendly web app that enables users to manage tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks via an input field, view them in a list, and remove them with a button. Tasks persist across browser sessions using localStorage, ensuring data is retained even after closing the browser. The application features a modern, responsive design with hover effects and smooth interactions, built without external frameworks.
Features

## Task Management:
Add tasks via an input field or by pressing "Enter."
Display tasks in an unordered list with a "Remove" button for each task.
Remove tasks with a single click.

### Data Persistence: 
Tasks are saved to localStorage, ensuring they remain available after browser refresh or closure.
### Responsive Design: 
Clean, centered layout with a max-width of 400px, styled with a modern aesthetic (Arial font, subtle shadows, and rounded corners).
### Interactive UI:
"Add Task" button changes color on hover (#007bff to #0056b3).
"Remove" buttons change color on hover (#ff6347 to #d9534f).

### Event Handling: 
Supports click events for adding/removing tasks and keypress events for adding tasks via "Enter."

## Learning Objectives

Advanced DOM Manipulation: Select and dynamically create HTML elements using JavaScript.
Event Handling: Attach event listeners for clicks and keypresses to manage user interactions.
Local Storage: Save and retrieve tasks using localStorage for data persistence.
Dynamic Web Application: Build a fully functional To-Do List with a focus on usability and maintainability.

## How to Run
```bash
Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/dynamic-to-do-list-js.git

Navigate to the project directory:cd dynamic-to-do-list-js
```
Open index.html in a web browser to use the To-Do List application.
Test functionality by adding, removing, and refreshing the page to verify task persistence.

## Development Approach

**Structure:** Organized JavaScript code within a DOMContentLoaded event listener to ensure DOM readiness.

**Code Quality:** Used clear variable names (e.g., taskInput, addButton, taskList) and included comments for major functions.

**Styling:** Leveraged provided CSS for a clean, modern UI with hover effects and a responsive layout.

**Testing:** Thoroughly tested adding, removing, and persisting tasks across browser sessions.
